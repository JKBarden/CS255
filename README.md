System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass wanted to create a system to provide additional to student to pass their driving test. The system would provide an online system for students to logon and be able to reserve time with a driving instructor or access to DrivePass online content. 

What did you do particularly well?

I tried to focus on the security aspect when designing the system. Having correct encapsulation and extra safe guards like limited login attempts to mitigate unauthorized users. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The use case diagram created is missing features and needs additional time to reorginize. The first itteration was veru messy and interconnected wuse cases too much. My second itteration is more orginized but missed features when redesigning it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Thinking on how the site I normally interact with and the user experience can help align the design with the user. Also thinking of a bad actor trying to access the site can help design in a way that protects the intended user. The user experience is essencial as a bad website can turn a user away very quickly. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

After doing additional research security is a major concern for the saftey of the users information. Keeping security as the main focus point can help reduce vulnerabilities. Next would be take each entity interacting with the system and break down each use case for each user first. This will satisfy a majority of the clients requierments and then any fine tuning can be completed after the use cases are completed. When use cases interconnect it starts to make the system look overly complex, keeping it simple and compact can make the system easier to understand as a whole.
